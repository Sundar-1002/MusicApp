# Music Recommendation System

Even though human emotions are complex and subtle, it is possible for a machine learning model to be trained to accurately detect a set of emotions which can be differentiated from each other with certain facial expressions. The expression on a persons face can be used to detect their mood, and once a certain mood has been detected, music suitable for the persons detected mood can be suggested. Our model, having the accuracy of approximately 75%, is able to detect seven moods accurately: anger, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise and neutral; and our android application is able to play the music that would be suitable for the detected mood.
